This is the sausage factory of the js in blueocean. You shouldn't need to look in here too often. 
Most of the action is in ExtensionPoint in extension-point.jsx. 


register-plugins.jsx is currently how extensions are registered, but this will be done automatically in future (likely based on what is installed on the server).
