# Style

All contributers will need to follow the style guide below for their changes to be accepted

## All languages
* For all languages the Intellij autoformatter wins, always. 
* If we want to change the code style we need to make sure the Intellij formatter config is changed and checked into the repository.
* Please include updates to the autoformatter as a seperate pull request.

## Java
* We follow the [Naming](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5-naming), [Programming Practices](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s6-programming-practices) and [Javadoc](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7-javadoc) styles from the [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) guide.
